This project is an Online Supermarket, developed using Spring Boot for the backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. The application aims to provide a convenient online shopping experience for customers to purchase groceries and other essential items from the comfort of their homes.

Features:

1. User Registration and Login: Customers can create new accounts by registering with their personal information. Existing users can log in to access their accounts and perform various actions.

2. Product Catalog: The supermarket offers a wide range of products categorized into different sections for easy navigation. Customers can browse through the catalog, view product details, and search for specific items.

3. Shopping Cart: Users can add products to their shopping cart while browsing the catalog. The cart keeps track of the selected items, quantities, and total prices. Customers can modify the cart by adding or removing products before proceeding to checkout.

4. Checkout Process: The application provides a seamless checkout process. Customers can review their order, enter shipping and billing details, and choose a preferred payment method. Once the order is confirmed, the system generates an order summary.

5. Order History: Users have access to their order history, which includes details of past purchases. This feature allows customers to track their previous orders and reorder items if needed.

6. User Dashboard: The application provides a personalized dashboard for each user. Customers can manage their account settings, update personal information, and track their activities within the supermarket.

Technologies Used:

Backend: The backend of the application is developed using Spring Boot, a Java-based framework that simplifies the development of web applications.    

Frontend: The frontend of the application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML is used for structuring the web pages, CSS for styling and layout, and JavaScript for dynamic behavior and interactivity.

Database: The project utilizes a relational database management system (here MySQL) to store and manage customer information, product data, and order details.
